The ISPR team at the Institut Pascal is a dedicated research laboratory specializing in intelligent vehicles. Their primary objective is to enable robots to navigate unfamiliar environments using cost-effective sensors and low-definition maps.

In pursuit of this goal, the lab has created a specially designed experimental town at a scale of 1/2, where each obstacle is geo-referenced.
