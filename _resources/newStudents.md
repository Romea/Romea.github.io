- Subscribe to the [Robotics Worldwide](https://www.robotics-worldwide.org/) and [euRobotics](http://mailing.eu-robotics.net/subscribe/community) mailing lists for updates on jobs, software releases, calls for journal special issues, and more at the global level.
- Subscribe to the [GdR Robotique](https://www.gdr-robotique.org) mailing list for updates on jobs, software releases, calls for journal special issues, and more at the national level in France.

## Kickstart Your Project/PhD

During the initial months, concentrate on two primary tasks:

- **Write a Research Project Report:** Describe your research subject, analyze the state of the art, and clearly outline the limitations of current methods.
  - Read extensively, but do so [smartly](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf).

- **Experiment with Robots:** Familiarize yourself with the [robot(s)](https://github.com/Tirrex-Roboterrium/tirrex_workspace) you will be using and test methods from the state of the art. Many of these methods should have public GitHub repositories available.

## Engage on Social Platforms

- **Join the Lab's Slack:** Explore the various channels.
  - Use private messages only for personal matters. Conduct research discussions in public channels to encourage collaboration.

- **Join the Research Unit's Teams:** Access higher-level information and coordination.
  - First, [activate your Microsoft license](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education), then ask a colleague to invite you to the relevant channels.
