excerpt: "Experimental park"
---

Located next to the lab's building, this private park of approximately 2 hectares of unstructured environment is used for preliminary tests of the robotics algorithms.

The park contains dirt road segments, patches of tall grass, bushes, and tall trees, allowing for a good representation of what unstructured environments can offer.
