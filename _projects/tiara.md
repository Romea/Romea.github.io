Robotics is increasingly seen as a means of supporting the ecological transition in agriculture, while reducing the arduousness of the work involved. The UR TSCF, and in particular its ROMEA team, has been working for several years on the challenges of agricultural robotics, through numerous projects; the results have demonstrated its ability to develop robots adaptable to natural environments and different contexts, in order to carry out a wide range of tasks.
The aim of LabCom TIARA is to accelerate the development of a versatile control architecture for SABI AGRI's ALPO electric tractors, enabling them to work autonomously in interaction with humans.

SABI AGRI, with its expertise in high-tech mechanics, mechatronics and robotics, has developed various models of versatile electric tractors suitable for all crops. By designing the ALPO Electric Tractor, the company has positioned itself as a pioneer in the agro-ecological electric agricultural equipment market. "The needs of agriculture are changing, and while farming is moving towards environmentally-friendly practices, agricultural equipment is not following the same path", notes Alexandre Pr√©vault Osmani, co-founder of SABI AGRI. 
The company has completely rethought the concept of the tractor to offer a light, powerful electric machine, adapted to the challenges of sustainable agriculture.
