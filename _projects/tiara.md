Agricultural robotics is recognized as a cornerstone of the third agricultural revolution, due to its role in facilitating the agroecological transition.
SABI AGRI, with its expertise in high-tech mechanics, mechatronics and robotics, has developed various models of electric tractors for autonomous farming. 
The joint laboratory between our lab and SABI AGRI will play a significant accelerator role for the entire sector by offering vehicles with adaptable levels of autonomy and shared decision-making capabilities to align with farmers' expectations. 
The combination of expertise in agricultural field knowledge and the powertrain of SABI AGRI's electric agricultural machinery, coupled with the research team's proficiency in agricultural robotics at INRAE, forms the foundation of the joint laboratory.
