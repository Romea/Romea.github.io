Robotics is increasingly seen as a means of supporting the ecological transition in agriculture, while reducing the arduousness of the work involved. The UR TSCF, and in particular its ROMEA team, has been working for several years on the challenges of agricultural robotics, through numerous projects; the results have demonstrated its ability to develop robots adaptable to natural environments and different contexts, in order to carry out a wide range of tasks.
The aim of LabCom TIARA is to accelerate the development of a versatile control architecture for SABI AGRI's ALPO electric tractors, enabling them to work autonomously in interaction with humans.

SABI AGRI, with its expertise in high-tech mechanics, mechatronics and robotics, has developed various models of versatile electric tractors suitable for all crops. By designing the ALPO Electric Tractor, the company has positioned itself as a pioneer in the agro-ecological electric agricultural equipment market. "The needs of agriculture are changing, and while farming is moving towards environmentally-friendly practices, agricultural equipment is not following the same path", notes Alexandre Pr√©vault Osmani, co-founder of SABI AGRI. 
The company has completely rethought the concept of the tractor to offer a light, powerful electric machine, adapted to the challenges of sustainable agriculture.

## Robotic cooperation :

In agriculture, the collaboration among robots plays a pivotal role in revolutionizing farming practices and aiding farmers in numerous ways. Robots working together in agricultural tasks bring forth increased efficiency, precision, and scalability. These machines can collaborate seamlessly to perform tasks such as planting, harvesting, weeding, and monitoring crop health. By sharing data and coordinating actions, they optimize resource utilization, minimize wastage, and reduce the physical strain on farmers. Furthermore, the synergy between robots enables the integration of advanced technologies like AI, IoT, and machine learning, empowering farmers with real-time insights for better decision-making. The significance of robot cooperation in agriculture lies in its potential to enhance productivity, sustainability, and ultimately contribute to ensuring food security for an ever-growing global population.

## Localisation and Perception :

The significance of localization through GPS or advanced sensors like LiDAR and cameras in various fields cannot be overstated. Precise localization is the cornerstone of numerous industries, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, logistics, and augmented reality. GPS technology provides global positioning, enabling accurate navigation and location tracking, fundamental for logistics optimization, route planning, and fleet management. On the other hand, LiDAR and camera-based systems offer high-resolution, real-time environmental mapping and object recognition, vital for autonomous vehicles' navigation, robotic operations, and even in fields like urban planning and forestry. These localization technologies empower machines and devices to perceive their surroundings with exceptional accuracy, ensuring safety, efficiency, and reliability in operations, ultimately driving innovation and advancement across industries on a global scale.
