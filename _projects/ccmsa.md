The use of biocontrol chemicals has a huge impact on farmers as they can be directly exposed. Therefore, the French Farmers Insurrence (CCMSA) charged INRAE to research on this topic to reduce the risk of chemical contamination of the farmers. This work lead to the development of a pulverisation tool that has been adapted on the [Adap2E](/_equipment/robots/adap2e.md) robot, leading to an autonomous pulverisation vehicle that is able to make structure following with autonomous pulverisation.
