The use of biocontrol chemicals has a huge impact on farmers as they can be directly exposed. Therefore, the French Farmers Insurance (CCMSA) charged INRAE to research on this topic to reduce the risk of chemical contamination of the farmers. This work lead to the development of a pulverisation tool that has been adapted on the [Adap2E](/_equipment/robots/adap2e.md) robot, leading to an autonomous pulverization vehicle that is able to make structure following with autonomous pulverization.
The developed pulverisation ramp and associated algorithm are able to independently activate the ramp nozzles based on the density of the vegetation. Therefore, the farmer can safely let a robot autonomously spray while reducing the amount of used chemical products.
