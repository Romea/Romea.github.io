Clément Chupin firstly joined the team as an intern during his last year of master of engineering. The aim was to bring advanced geometric analysis algorithms to plant detection and row tracking for 3D LiDARs.
This led to the development of a plant detection algorithm, first based on Artificial Intelligence, then based on classical and probabilistic algorithms to manage errors and disturbances in an agricultural environment.

Clément obtained his Master’s degree Artificial Perception and Robotics at University Clermont-Auvergne in 2023.
