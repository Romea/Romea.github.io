Johann Laconte made his debut in research by interacting with the [Northern Robotics Laboratory](https://norlab.ulaval.ca) during his studies in computer engineering at Clermont Auvergne University, working on the modeling of lidar sensors.
He got his Engineering degree from this university in 2018, along a Master's degree in robotics. 
He completed his Ph.D. at Institut Pascal (France) and Laval University (Canada) in 2021 during which he participated in several robotic deployments in unstructured environments, including subarctic forests.
This work was awarded the second prize for the [best french Ph.D. thesis in robotics](https://www.gdr-robotique.org/prix_de_these/?an=2021).
After a six-month postdoc at the Northern Robotics Laboratory ([Norlab](https://norlab.ulaval.ca)), he continued his research at the University of Toronto in Mobile Robotics ([ASRL](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/)).

Since October 2023, he is the recipient of a junior research chair in the robotics department of the French National Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE).

His research interests focus on mobile robotics and the interactions between the robot and deformable, ever-changing environments.
