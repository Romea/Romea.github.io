Florian Gaurier firstly joined the team as an intern during his last year of master of engineering. The goal was to migrate and evaluate the structure following and detection algorithms with 3D LiDARs.
The internship rose up subsidiary objectives about pointcloud based recognition algorithms. This lead to the development of an algorithm able to detect rows and obstacles between rows only on geometric features with CPU computation and AI free implementation.

Florian obtained his Master of Science in Engineering at ENSTA Bretagne in 2022, specialized in robotics. The ENSTA Bretagne robotics team is specialized in marine robotics (UAV and USV) with an expertise in applied mathematics and dead recogning problematics.
