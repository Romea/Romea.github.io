**Tom Montagnon** is a doctoral researcher at [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/en), [Institut Pascal](http://www.institutpascal.uca.fr/index.php/fr/), and [NARO](https://www.naro.go.jp/english/). His research focuses Modeling and Navigation in Environments with Deformable Soil.

I hold a two-year technical degree (DUT) in Computer Science, which provided me with a solid foundation in programming and networking. I later pursued a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at [ISIMA](https://www.isima.fr/en/home/), specializing in embedded systems. I also completed a Masterâ€™s Degree in Robotics and Artificial Perception at the [University of Auvergne](https://www.uca.fr/formation/nos-formations/catalogue-des-formations/masters-degree-artificial-perception-robotics).

For my final internship, I spent six months in Japan at the National Institute of Informatics [NII](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), where I worked on integrating reinforcement learning algorithms (World Model, Dreamer), into the "Solo-12" quadruped robot.
